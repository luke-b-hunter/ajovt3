# Visual style for a made up political party

**Github version**

* For my thesis project I decided to create a visual style for my own made up frivolous political party. Political satire has it’s own history, that hasn’t been examined
properly and because of it’s small effectiveness amd influence in politics, it has mostly remained forgotten in our society. And so a majority of people can barely remember any
frivolous parties, despite there being already a few throughout political history. There is a tradition of humorouss way of seeing life, that is deeply engraved in Czech
mentality, starting with the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek and so it makes sense to continue with that tradition in my thesis project.

* The aim of this thesis is to introduce political satire through my own personal movement and it's visual style. The tradition of humorous way of seeing life is deeply
engraved in Czech mentality, starting with the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek and his party called The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law, and so it makes
sense to continue with that tradition in through thesis project. 

* The main sources is a comprehensive research of other frivolous parties and a research of logos of existing poltitical movements and political and marketing literature. In my
thesis, I'm researching the way on how other frivolous parties functioned and communicated and from that I'm deducing my own project. I'm also woking with current geogpolitical
situations in the world that are crucial for the creation of my platform. In my theoretical part I'm taking a slight inspiration from other frivolous parties styles but
essentialy creating my own visual assets. 

* The goal is to create a visual design for my own political party. This party should be flexible in a way, where it can react to other political problems, the routes it can
take are many. The party can cooperate with other frivolous parties or it can turn into a real political party.

**Thesis version**

* The topic of this bachelor thesis is the process of creating a design of a visual identity and a platform for my own frivolous party. Political satire has it’s own history,
that hasn’t been examined properly and because of it’s small effectiveness amd influence in politics, it has mostly remained forgotten in society. And so a majority of people
can barely remember any frivolous parties, despite there being already a few throughout political history. 

* The aim of this work is to introduce readers with the most famous frivolous parties in the world and at home, so we can create a comprehensive understanding of our problem,
which will then be followed with a practical part and in the practical part, create my own platform and a uniform visual style for my political movement and eventually, create
my own communication strategy as well.

* In the theoretical part, I’m focusing on defining political satire, where I emphasize on it‘s position in society and how we should understand it. Then, I’m devoting a part of
this work to a list of frivolous political parties in the world according to it’s country of operation and I’m devoting the next part to existence of frivolous parties in the
Czech lands as well. In the theoretical part, I’m also focusing on functioning movements in the world, that aren’t operating directly in politics, but are being used as a fixed
foundation for understanding the process of creating my own movement. 

* In the practical part, I’m focusing on the creation of my own political platform for my own movement, the creation of visual communication for this movement and the
characterization of my own movement followed with it’s own strategic communication.
